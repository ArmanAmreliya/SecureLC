# Push Notifications - REMOVED FROM PROJECT

## Status: ‚ùå REMOVED

Push notification functionality has been **removed** from the SecureLC project to focus on core features that work reliably in Expo Go during development.

## Why Removed?

1. **Expo Go Limitation**: Push notifications don't work in Expo Go for SDK 53+ (project uses SDK 54)
2. **Development Focus**: Streamlining to core features that can be tested immediately
3. **Production Complexity**: Requires development builds and additional setup complexity

## What Was Removed?

### Files Deleted:
- ‚ùå `services/notificationService.js` - Complete notification service
- ‚ùå Push notification imports from `src/_layout.js`
- ‚ùå Notification setup code from `src/(auth)/login.js`

### Packages Uninstalled:
```bash
npm uninstall expo-notifications expo-device expo-constants
```

### Configuration Cleaned:
- ‚ùå Removed `expo-notifications` plugin from `app.json`
- ‚ùå Removed notification-related configuration

## Current Project Focus

### ‚úÖ **Working Core Features:**
1. **Authentication System** - Firebase Auth with biometric login
2. **Audio Recording** - Line clear request recording with expo-audio
3. **Request Management** - Create, view, delete requests
4. **Professional UI** - Government app styling with yellow theme
5. **Real-time Data** - Firebase Firestore integration

### üéØ **Next Priority: GPS Tracking Enhancement**

The current GPS tracking in `src/(tabs)/index.js` needs enhancement to:
1. **Save location data to Firestore** when tracking is active
2. **Associate GPS coordinates with active requests**
3. **Enable supervisor monitoring** of field worker locations
4. **Implement real-time location updates**

## Future Consideration

Push notifications can be re-added later when:
1. Moving to production builds
2. Setting up development build workflow with `expo-dev-client`
3. Implementing proper server-side notification logic

For now, the app focuses on **proven, testable features** that work excellently in Expo Go.

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development server
npx expo start --offline

# Test core features in Expo Go
# - Login/logout
# - Audio recording
# - Request management
# - GPS tracking UI
```

The project is now **cleaner, focused, and fully functional** for core line clear request management!

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Firebase CLI** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-cli
   firebase login
   ```

2. **Initialize Firebase Functions**:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Projects\SecureLC\SecureLC
   firebase init functions
   ```
   - Select JavaScript
   - Install dependencies when prompted

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install expo-server-sdk
   ```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Copy the Cloud Function Code**:
   - Copy the contents of `firebase-functions-template.js` to `functions/index.js`

2. **Deploy the Functions**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

3. **Test the Setup**:
   - Login to the app to register push token
   - Manually change a request status to "approved" in Firebase Console
   - Check if notification is received

### Testing

1. **Test Push Token Registration**:
   - Login to the app
   - Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí users collection
   - Verify user document has `pushToken` field

2. **Test Notification Function**:
   - Create a test request
   - Manually change status to "approved" in Firestore
   - Check device for notification

### Troubleshooting

1. **No Push Token Saved**:
   - Check device permissions for notifications
   - Verify internet connection during login
   - Check console logs for errors

2. **Notifications Not Received**:
   - Verify Cloud Function is deployed successfully
   - Check Function logs in Firebase Console
   - Ensure Expo push token is valid
   - Check device notification settings

3. **Invalid Push Token Error**:
   - Update to latest Expo SDK
   - Ensure app is running on physical device (not simulator for push notifications)

### Security Considerations

1. **Firestore Rules**: Ensure users can only read/write their own documents
2. **Function Security**: Cloud Functions automatically authenticate with Firebase Admin SDK
3. **Token Management**: Push tokens are automatically refreshed by Expo

### Future Enhancements

1. **Notification Categories**: Add different notification types (denied, completed)
2. **Notification History**: Store sent notifications for user reference
3. **Notification Preferences**: Allow users to customize notification settings
4. **Rich Notifications**: Add action buttons for quick responses
